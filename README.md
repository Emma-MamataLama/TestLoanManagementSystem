# TestLoanManagementSystem
**Introduction**
The application called "WebLoanApp" is a web based banking application used to evaluate eligibility of potential customer to get a loan. When bank employee enters customer's monthly income and debt, 
WebLoanApp should automatically calculate maximum amount of loan eligible and monthly payments (assuming that income is higher than debt). System also allows creating and printing a letter that can be 
sent to the customer with Loan conditions. Each employee gets an access to unique instance of WebLoanApp (bank branch). Each branch has a role of branch admin assigned to the employee. Admin can create other users (bank clerks) and customers.
